Lab: Console and Cloud Shell

Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

Get access to Google Cloud.

Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.

Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell.

Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.


Task 1: Create a bucket using the Cloud Console
command:
gsutil mb gs://princebucks2


Task 2: Access Cloud Shell

Task 3: Create a bucket using Cloud Shell
command:
gsutil mb gs://princebucks3

Task 3: Explore more Cloud Shell features
Upload a file
Open Cloud Shell.

Click the three dots (b4af82f98f85f64f.png) icon in the Cloud Shell toolbar to display further options.

Click Upload file. Upload any file from your local machine to the Cloud Shell VM. This file will be referred to as [MY_FILE].

In Cloud Shell, type ls to confirm that the file was uploaded.
Copy the file into one of the buckets you created earlier in the lab. Replace [MY_FILE] with the file you uploaded and [BUCKET_NAME] with one of your bucket names:

command:
gsutil cp [MY_FILE] gs://princebucks2


Task 5: Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell
Open Cloud Shell from the Cloud Console. Note that this allocates a new VM for you.

To list available regions, execute the following command:

command: gcloud compute regions list


Create and verify an environment variable
Create an environment variable and replace [YOUR_REGION] with the region you selected in the previous step:

command: INFRACLASS_REGION=us-east1

Verify it with echo:

command: echo $INFRACLASS_REGION
  
Create a subdirectory for materials used in this class:

command: mkdir infraclass

Create a file called config in the infraclass directory:

command: touch infraclass/config

Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file:

command: echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config

Create a second environment variable for your Project ID, replacing [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your Project ID. You can find the project ID on the Cloud Console Home page.

command: INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=qwiklabs-gcp-00-4009260afcce

Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file:

command: echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config

Use the source command to set the environment variables, and use the echo command to verify that the project variable was set:

source infraclass/config
echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

This gives you a method to create environment variables and to easily recreate them if the Cloud Shell is cycled. However, you will still need to remember to issue the source command each time Cloud Shell is opened.

In the next step you will modify the .profile file so that the source command is issued automatically any time a terminal to Cloud Shell is opened.

Close and re-open Cloud Shell. Then issue the echo command again:

echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

There will be no output because the environment variable no longer exists.

Modify the bash profile and create persistence
Edit the shell profile with the following command:

command: nano .profile

Add the following line to the end of the file:

command: source infraclass/config

Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

Close and then re-open Cloud Shell to cycle the VM.

Use the echo command to verify that the variable is still set:

command: echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
